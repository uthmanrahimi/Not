<b>Not</b> Is a Library based on .NET Core .

It provides some extension methods that make easy to apply ! on some variables . With <b>Not</b> you do not need to use `!` in your code .


# Boolean
instead of following code 

``` 
if (!validationResult.Successed)
            {
                //do somethis
            }
```
with <b>Not</b> you change code like this :


``` if (!validationResult.Successed)
            {
                //do somethis
            }```
